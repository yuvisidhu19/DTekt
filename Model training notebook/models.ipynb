Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile.Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won\\'t take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain\\'t. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it\\'s better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.First Of All I Bought This for my Dad against his old MI 5A .I Got This For 6800 Only.Please Dont This in Buy in 9000/-.My Review Scores Are-Battery Backup- 10/10Storage - 10/10Camera - Rear(7/10);Front(5/10)Sensers - 10/10Build Quality - 10/10Looks - 10/10Performance -9/10(Not Gaming Type Phone Cause G35)Overall Suggestion Is :You Should Buy If●You Are Normal User who wants long battery backup(WA/FB/Insta/Uthoob/Calls)●Looks Matters●You Are Not \" Selfie-Lover \" Type PersonYou Shouldn\\'t Buy If●You have hardcore needs like video editing,coding, designing●You Are Hardcore Gamer●You Are \"Selfie Wala Person\"Thankyou😎P.S:- You Can Consider Redmi 9 Prime If You Are Second Category😁It isa good phone which is orange a nice colour I love it it features are better than other phones',\n",

On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it\\'s hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing.

Let\\'s look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain \"cool\" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I\\'m touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone\\'s fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we\\'ve seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That\\'s slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor.

Call speaker volume (internal) is toooooo less. It is so irritating. I wasted my money on this phone. Only the battery backup is good. Rest i wasted my money on this. The phone is unnecessarily too heavy. I should have spended extra 1200 rupees and bought Samsung M series phone rather than this worthless phone.Mobile screen in good,battery backup excelent,Daily usage good,Gaming experience Laggy PUBG, Call of Duty is almost not possible to play in this game,it has 4gb RAM but still not good enough to handle gamesCamera quality is worst, not even near to expectations.Chinese's knows well how to attract Indians, Camera Megapixel, Camera filter, sound, Big screen and very common attractive looks.for normal usage like calling messaging, whatsapp and all this device is more then enough,If you are game lover or photography lover this device is not at all for you,If you just want a decent android mobile for daily usage its goodThe media could not be loaded.Overheating within 15-20 mins of usage.Screen flickering on auto brightness. Also flickering if brightness is kept below 50%.One of the worst phones I've used till date.All specs are good at this price. Only camera is not up to the mark and charging speed is slow because 10W of charger . At 9k we can not expect more than that. At this price getting 4+64, MIUI version is 12.0.1 , android 10.That is good part of this phone .If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.The media could not be loaded.The camera quality is absolutely worse. Me and my family members have been using redmi mobiles and all of mobiles have a great camera quality. This was the reason and trust I ordered one more redmi mobile for my younger brother but I'm surprised with the camera quality. it's very bad and guys don't buy this mobile if you're looking for a good camera in the mobile. There are other mobiles available in redmi and other company which is more worthy. I'll attach some pictures so that you guys can aware of this before buying.Never falling for cheap price again. I got it for 7149₹ at sale with extra 10% card discount. It was good for couple of months. Then it started showing some issues. I bought 4gb ram variant. Yet it got slower than my old phone which is 2gb ram. My old phone's camera is Front 2mp and Rear 8mp. But still my older phone gives much better image till date. My older phone's battery was 2400mah, and again Redmi 9 last only till evening, when charged in morning. Whereas my older phone lasted till Night with remaining 20-30% battery.I thought I was upgrading to a better phone, but no, I paid over 7000₹ for phone that is worse than my 5 year old phone. All the fancy features are nothing but gimmicks to attract customers. It's a cheap phone, that obviously have cheap parts in it. That will work fine for sometime but eventually devolve.This is a very good product with low price. Thanks Amazon and Redmi Mobile for this product.Excellent looks and colour and awesome features.I love this product too much thanks Amazon again.This phone is a budget smartphone with decent performance. I am using this phone for last 3 months so I am sharing my views basis my experience. If you are bying it for regular uasge like calls, watching YouTube and whatsapp then it's good. Don't consider this phone for gaming or heavy usage as it lags then. I hav bought this phone for my son for his online classes, calls and for YouTube videos so it's working fine.I used to have a Motorola Moto G5S Plus phone as a secondary phone and recently i changed this to Redmi 9. Here are the advantages and disadvantages. This is assembled in India and is a good value for money offering.Advantages1) I wanted to replace the phone with the cheaptest entry point phone with a good display.The Redmi offer HD+ not full HD, but it is okay for my usage.2) The MIUI is extremely pleasing to the eye and gives a good user experience.3) The ease of set up of Redmi 9 was awesome. It was a dual SIM phone with Volte and 4 G SIM support on both SIM4) Also we can extend the existing 64 GB storage with upto 512 GB SD card, I have procured another 64 GB storage5) It has an FM radio thrown in as well.6) The camera is okay not highly fancy similar to the Redmi 9 Power, but this being a secondary phone I am okay with the overal performance.Disadvantages1) The charger is the only mini USB and wish this was a USB C type charge with quick charge.2) The Wifi detects only 2.4 GHz and not the latest 5GHz hence the overall connectivty speed is low.For the price point that is 2500 Rs less due to exchange and overall pay out to be around 6150 Rs, this phone is a value for money offering. At the time of buying this was the top phone in the Amazon phone range, but given a choice would have opted for Redmi 9 Power, that had a better feature.\",\n",
              " 'What is main use of a phone?...obviously to receive and make calls....if you are not able hear anything properly then whats the use of a phone. Call speaker volume (internal) is toooooo less. It is so irritating. I wasted my money on this phone. Only the battery backup is good. Rest i wasted my money on this. The phone is unnecessarily too heavy. I should have spended extra 1200 rupees and bought Samsung M series phone rather than this worthless phone.',\n",
              " \"Mobile screen in good,battery backup excelent,Daily usage good,Gaming experience Laggy PUBG, Call of Duty is almost not possible to play in this game,it has 4gb RAM but still not good enough to handle gamesCamera quality is worst, not even near to expectations.Chinese's knows well how to attract Indians, Camera Megapixel, Camera filter, sound, Big screen and very common attractive looks.for normal usage like calling messaging, whatsapp and all this device is more then enough,If you are game lover or photography lover this device is not at all for you,If you just want a decent android mobile for daily usage its good\",\n",
              " \"The media could not be loaded.Overheating within 15-20 mins of usage.Screen flickering on auto brightness. Also flickering if brightness is kept below 50%.One of the worst phones I've used till date.\",\n",
              " 'All specs are good at this price. Only camera is not up to the mark and charging speed is slow because 10W of charger . At 9k we can not expect more than that. At this price getting 4+64, MIUI version is 12.0.1 , android 10.That is good part of this phone .',\n",
              " \"If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.\",\n",
              " \"The media could not be loaded.The camera quality is absolutely worse. Me and my family members have been using redmi mobiles and all of mobiles have a great camera quality. This was the reason and trust I ordered one more redmi mobile for my younger brother but I'm surprised with the camera quality. it's very bad and guys don't buy this mobile if you're looking for a good camera in the mobile. There are other mobiles available in redmi and other company which is more worthy. I'll attach some pictures so that you guys can aware of this before buying.\",\n",
              " \"Never falling for cheap price again. I got it for 7149₹ at sale with extra 10% card discount. It was good for couple of months. Then it started showing some issues. I bought 4gb ram variant. Yet it got slower than my old phone which is 2gb ram. My old phone's camera is Front 2mp and Rear 8mp. But still my older phone gives much better image till date. My older phone's battery was 2400mah, and again Redmi 9 last only till evening, when charged in morning. Whereas my older phone lasted till Night with remaining 20-30% battery.I thought I was upgrading to a better phone, but no, I paid over 7000₹ for phone that is worse than my 5 year old phone. All the fancy features are nothing but gimmicks to attract customers. It's a cheap phone, that obviously have cheap parts in it. That will work fine for sometime but eventually devolve.\",\n",
              " 'This is a very good product with low price. Thanks Amazon and Redmi Mobile for this product.Excellent looks and colour and awesome features.I love this product too much thanks Amazon again.',\n",
              " \"This phone is a budget smartphone with decent performance. I am using this phone for last 3 months so I am sharing my views basis my experience. If you are bying it for regular uasge like calls, watching YouTube and whatsapp then it's good. Don't consider this phone for gaming or heavy usage as it lags then.

Return policy is not applicable and only replacement is possible with same mobile and that too in the case of recieving only damaged product.

No where they have mentioned clearly that the mobile can not be returned except for damage, only they are mentioning that 7 days replacement is possible making it dubious for customers. Kind of feeling cheated withAmazon as When I have resources available but still will have to bear with a lower end mobile whose performance is not at par just because it can not be replaced by Amazon. Not sure when Amazon started these cheap kind of gimmicks erasing it's brand name. No support by Amazon for this kind of performance/satisfaction issue with product. Think twice before purchasing this redmi 9 activ mobile. Only if you have budget issues then only buy this mobile. Because once bought it can not be returned. The phone is lagging in speed also.

Service Centres will simply say that Mother Board has problem and will ask you exorbitant amount to repair it.You will be forced to buy a new one.This has happened to me second time with Xiaomi mobiles.I am never going to buy a Xiaomi ever. Since 2014, at least 10-12 Xiaomi mobiles were bought in my family, Redmi / Mi / Poco and I had recommended dozens of my friends.. But no more.Xiaomi is over for me.I have checked it myself that the second space feature is not available in this phone. MI customer care is saying it has second space and service centre saying it does not have . I did not find any better solution other than returning it because a brand like MI is misguiding customers. The hardware is so downgraded that it cannot handle second space . So they have removed the feature from this phone which is available in each and every phone running MIUI.

If you are looking for faster internet speed then take a note on this, that this phone won’t support 5GHz wifi connectivity.Also noticed that the while having video call through WhatsApp, the call gets disconnected after a few minutes and then never gets connected.Sometimes it auto restarts.I am regretting on decision to buy this phone for my mom.

Same day I called to support they initiated replacement. Delivery boy came to my home at same day. He tried to power on mobile, as I already said this mobile is not powering on. He started argument without IMEI varification I will not give you the replacement. My question is here if mobile is dead then how and why he was insisting. Did customer care support team have raised proper request for replacement. Carrier guy cancel my replacement. I called again to customer care I explained everything and they said once replacement cancelled. We can only refund. I accepted that preposal as well. Same thing happened here again when carrier guy came to my home same question asked for IMEI varification I need to power on mobile.boss if phone is dead then how you will varify.

But i haven't used phone in wet hand at all neither it went into water. Pathetic service experience ever faced in service center. Then i went for another option of open market where they took 2000/-and my phone started working as usual where as service center manager refused to repair and told me the expense will come around 8000/- to replace display as well main bord of the phone.

This is NOT how a brand new phone, however budget, should be performing.This is high end budget phone that is packed with features. It is ideal for teens and students.

I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.Nice productSomeone should give Nobel Prize for creating such a third class phone. If you put your phone idle for a few minutes SIM card is not getting detected. (Screenshots attached). So I became not reachable over phone. Now with a restart it again can detect both the SIM and joyfully if you give a call to someone from either of the dual SIMs on the other side over the phone none will hear any sound 🙄 now thinking if I had bought any feature phone atleast I can connect to people over a call. Now when bought , Amazon showed 7 days replacement but now waiting for some technician visit to confirm that this model has a manufacturing problem. So a strong No No for this product. Don't be trapped over the lesser price rather go for some pro Series of redmi if needed.phone is not value for moneyThe camera is worst i ever seen in any no redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.mobile display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera. The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 primeIf you pay peanuts you get monkeys - that's quite true for the Redmi 9. With good specs on paper available at the then low price of Rs 9000 I made a greed-fueled decision to go for this. After 3 months I find the glass has scratched all too easily (as opposed to my Lenovo smartphone), the MIUI OS is buggy as hell and the gyroscope just does not work so moving the phone around does not change the orientation in GPS maps (or games). Overall a pathetic device.i bought this phone for my mother, she mainly uses it for calling and zoom meetings of her religious seminars from indians around the world. battery life was my great concern but this phone does its job, she gets by with 18 to 26% battery life remaining by time its time for dinner in the evening.Fingerprint reader is not so great, I will give it a 2/5 rating. it often fails to recognise fingers, even mine.Its a great phone but don't buy Acko insurance with it as theyvare fraud.I bought the insurance with the phone, I got a message from Acko to register and I did. I saw the insurance being activated on my number and the device but the very next day without any reason they cancelled it themselves . Then it was a fight between them and Amazon. Amazon suggest to buy the insurance again which I did and again Acko denied it as it was not bought with the phone. I just feel its a fraud going on, they generate interest with insurance with phone and later cheat like this. DONT BUT ACKO insurance\",\n",

One of the worst and horrible phone Redmi ACTIV 9.I have purchased this phone on June 8th 2022 now i'm facing issues with the speakers (sometimes speakers gets off automatically), when i call the customer care Mr.Shivakumar who spoke to me very easily he says to visit MI service centre purchasing this phone all it required me to visit the service centre to repair the non-suitable phone which is there in the market.I will definitely raise my voice in social media to not purchase this worst brand. Very very haphazard experience.I need a replacement of this phone at any cost.Redmi 9 (4GB RAM + 64GB Storage) Delivered by Amazon on 4th Aug, first two week worked properly.But after that started facing below 2 issues.1. This mobile is unable to detect any SIM, tried with factory reset too.2. Also noticed that volume bar popping up on screen automatically and unable to increase the Mobile volume by using button, this issue got disappeared for some time after rebooting the mobile but that reboot button is also not functioning sometime, need to press that button multiple time to get the reboot / power off option screen on mobile.Best Budget phone.Dear Customers please remember that the Price is always directly propotional to the quality.This low price model lacks Type C Charging port. There is no Type C port. Its the old pin.Sound quality is really worst.My sincere advice to spend 1000 more and go for Mi 9 Pro.It is not C-type chager that's the first thing to fooling the customer and second one is every mi phone hasir blaster but it doesn't having, I bought redmi8 it has both features and as it is old model and I bought it for @of ₹8000 Only but nNow it has 8799 by loosing the these features as I am get fool for the product I bought and Amazon also having the hand in it. It has to be take responsible for itLet's start with the pros:A really good battery. Easily runs for an entire day in higher than average use. Lightweight, Sleek, Has smooth fingerprint sensor, loud and has a really good processor if you're a game lover. The photos despite twin cam setup are good and only get grainy in low light. Use pro-mode if you want the best output.Cons:No type C charge or Fast Charge Support. Could have been better had there been tri cam setup like Poco C3 (it lacks FingerPrint Sensor though). Non Stock Android is a turn off as phones like Moto G10 Power and many other have either Stock Android or lesser bloatwares while MIUI is notorious with its UI.Summary: Go for it if you're MIUI user as it will feel very homely. Also, if you are a game lover an want something under 10K, this is one of the options you should go for. Don't opt for it if you're hardcore into photography.7.5/10Specification good enoughBought for attending online classes and it is very smooth. Have tried streaming videos, MS office files and I have not seen any lags.Not much of a gamer so haven't utilized 100% of HW.Charging time is about 3 hours and lasts more than a day.Camera quality average.1 major concern for me is the display when the phone is operated outdoor. The brightness level is so low we can barely see anything under the sun lightVery bad experience in that mobile I purchased.. the mobile camera clearity is not good and veryvery poor qualityI bet a Redmi series of phone doesn't need reviews. It's always the best for budget. Only pros is lagging after a while due to more bug fix updates and usage of more apps. Otherwise Redmi rockzzzAmazing product 😊 thanks youProduct is nice,battery life also good,apart from camera quality not apto the mark but overall value for money product....only issue is they not provide me tempered glass & back cover too along with handset...they should provide this 2 things together...overall fine...thanks😊💐👍\",\n",

Thisproduct had a exchange option where i had to return my older phone. No problems. The entire process took 10 mins. The executive came took my phone check a few things and game me the new phone and left. Amazing !!The product is good to use, but giving 1 star because I can't use it to call anymore the speakers are too low to hear other persons voice..Not recommended..Bought 4 pieces for the staff all of them have similar issues.Maybe I should have to stick to a good brand.I don't like the phone because it is not working in manner..It is self rebooting continually in every 10Seconds.Please mark this issue and start rectifying in further device production...Because your service centres are not being operated in service manner..Actually they just manipulate the all customer instead of resolving the issues..#Mi service centre , aggarwal plaza, mangalam palace, M2K sector-3 , Rohini , Delhi .Dont purchase products from this seller,all the products are defective.First time when i ordered memory card slot was not working and second time when i applied for exchange they had again given damage phone,this time there was some error in display and sometimes phone gets automatically switched off, suffered a lot at last i had to refund the phone and purchase from somewhere else.Very bad experience this time,its my request to amazon to please look over it and ensure the quality of products.Overall my mom is really happy with the phone, Battery life is really good, and usage is good.Camera is horrible but my mom dont care, and brightness is low compared to her tablet, and other phones in the house. My mom need it just for casual music on speaker, youtube and calls sometimes. So if you feel this is similar to yours situation then goahead. BTW I got it for 8.2K so it fine for the price. Do not pay more than 8.5K for this.The product is good but some issues with sound. Every time the sound of the phone goes off and needs to restart again and again. We are unable to here even the phone call. Full phone features goes on mute and need to restart every time. Amazon had deliver me faulty phone.I have purchased this and gifted. This is not a good phone where the quality and the performance is poor.Camera is poor.Charging slot is not type-C & not quick charge too, will have to wait approx 3 hours to complete the charge.Screen rotation is poor where it is taking 1-2 complete seconds to rotate the screen.Overall the quality and the performance of the phone is poor. I would recommend to not go with this phone.Atleast am allowed to write this comments in Amazon whereas if I would have purchased in mi.com, they'll block my comments and will not post if I give a rating less-than 4.Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. ThanksAt this price range if you want to buy a mobile for your online class and for your children then I will recommend this product. If you want to buy this mobile for other purposes then I will recommend to don't buy it.And don't go to the youtube review . Really it too different after I buy I knew very well.So it is your choice what you di.It uses mediatek G35 that is sufficient for whatsapp, messengers, email, GoogleMeet, Zoom. Not for Gaming, but everyday use for business communication is okay if you are on a budget. Camera pathetic too much white balance, I had realme C3 much better than Redmi9Activ. Overall happy as i dont play games, do FB, watch Youtube.\",\n",

Overall it is not meeting my requirements and not happy with the phone. I kindly request to arrange to take back the unit and payment at the earliest.Thanking you,Your's sincerely,Writing the review after 3 months of usage.1. Look and fell of the product is good.2. Fingerprint sensor is bit laggy.Sometimes it didn't read the fingerprints.3. Performance is ok, Can't say it's too slow. But if you want fast performance than go for something else.4. Camera quality is ok. Not too good but not to bad.5. Battery life is good.I bought it for my mom and it serve the purpose.If you want to use all the capabilities of smart phone please look for something else.phone is good. works smooth. but camera is very disappointing....My primary phone screen shattered and due to lockdown I'm unable to fix it.Ordered redmi 9 and Amazon delivered in1day. A miracle! At these times.Great phone for the price, really happy with performance. Never heats up. Battery last 2 days with heavy use.Camera very very poor quality.So if buying for camera consider higher models.Highly impressed for the price.Go for it.The media could not be loaded.Amazing my phone radmi 9 active I lave 💝you radmi and my most amazon❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️💖💖💞💞💗❤❤💕💕💕💕❤💗💞💞💖❣️💓💓💝💝💓❣️💖💖💞💗❤💕💕💕💕💕💕💕❤💗💞💖💓 fingerprint and bttery and camera quality amazing😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 amazing my phone 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖Purchased this around may end and got it delivered by June 1st week 2021 and I am writing this review on 2nd September 2021. So basically I have used this for 3 months. I am not someone who uses phone for gaming or prolong use. I use it just for calls, message,mails, WhatsApp and payment. That's it. Not even fb, insta, Netflix, prime, nothing. So I have basic uses. Still this phone started showing problems in less than 3 months. Problems that the phone showed in less than 3 months:1) It has started slowing down2) the charger wire has loosened up and I had to use a spare one which I had3) the phone is so heavy that when you hold your phone in your hand for long calls like 30 mins call without using earphone, or if you chat for some 15-20 mins, your wrist will hurt, I got carpal tunnel syndrome by using this just for 3 months and planning to get a minor surgery soon.

I had to buy this when my samsung phone got into a drain and I really needed one asap and during May month all shops were closed for 2nd wave of covid. This phone will definitely show some issue withing few months even if u r a moderate user, not using much social media and not palying any games.Good look phone with 5000mh battery, but camera quality too disappointing. No IR blaster, No C type port. I had purchased redmi 9 (4/64) by exchanging Redmiy3 (3/32) . But actulalky redmi y3 is far better then redmi9. I desire to return it.

I am not someone who uses phone for gaming or prolong use. I use it just for calls, message,mails, WhatsApp and payment. That's it. Not even fb, insta, Netflix, prime, nothing. So I have basic uses. Still this phone started showing problems in less than 3 months. Problems that the phone showed in less than 3 months:1) It has started slowing down2) the charger wire has loosened up and I had to use a spare one which I had3) the phone is so heavy that when you hold your phone in your hand for long calls like 30 mins call without using earphone, or if you chat for some 15-20 mins, your wrist will hurt, I got carpal tunnel syndrome by using this just for 3 months and planning to get a minor surgery soon.

It doesn\\'t have c type charging but once you charge it which takes around three hours, it goes very long. Performance is also good.

On Amazon. .. I recommend consider about this phone . .. Thank you. ..Processor is slow!!Touch is not good !!I had not used this phone much. But last month i gave this to my mom nd she was very irritated because of hanging probmm!! Within 6 mnth it gave me feeling of dabba hai dabba 😒!! Please don’t waste your money on this product, instead of it, invest 2-3k more nd buy a 4 gb ram product.I am a student and it's a best MI phone under this range. Camera quality is a bit low at this price and battery is also good no issue till date (aprox 6 month). But if you are looking for a phone for gaming u need to rise your budget. Otherwise it's good fingerprint scanner is fast and face unloce is super fast the security system is also good. 6gb ram and 128gb storage with this performance in this price is something next level. You still can play many games like standof 2, free fire, etc. which have medium graphic very smoothly. This phone dident disappointed me. I am very satisfied with this phone. I recommend you to buy this phone if u are a student 😃Redmi 9... Other than MIUI 12.0.5, 4GBRAM &64GB this phone is very ordinary. The CAMERA is worst compared to older phones frm XIAOMI..NO LED LIGHT FOR NOTIFICATIONS...overall nothing impressive in this phone.. Quite disappointed.ADDING one PROS abt the phone:Sound quality is good.Battery life good.Bought 3 weeks Bach.. Touch screen is not that smooth.. does not respond properly..need to click multiple times to perform an operation..terrible experience..not expected from Xiomi..Ihave used multiple redmi phonesstarting 1S every thing was fine.. but this is wasted..not recommendI bought it for my mother, and she is learning to use it. 4GB/64GB at this price is really good. Touch is very responsive and quick. Screen quality is little dull and sound output is low compared to other Redmi phones. Redmi needs to work on these for budget phones. Camera is average as it is not camera centered phone. Network reception and battery power is good, last for 1.5 days with normal usage. Overall good phone for beginners and elderly people to start withWill not find a better phone in this price range. It's good for surfing, YouTube, not for heavy gaming. Small games run good. Have other phones comparing with mi note 9 pro. It's slower. Charging time is standard 70 minutes for full. This phone assures of reliability as built quality is very goodI bought this product based on my past experience with Redmi note 5 which was really Good. This time I got disappointed after purchasing this product. Everything was going fine for the first 3-4 days but all of sudden my phone get starting auto restart at the interval of less than a minutes. I am not able to use my phone from yesterday since it is auto restart as soon as I unlock it. Not satisfied with this product at all.The product is not new and seems to be a refurbished phone. The quality of audio is super bad. Hangs all the time. Please do not purchase this phone online.I am using this mobile on 6th marchFrom starting date to till now mbl will be overheating and sometimes hanging and another thing is sometimes touch will not workingThat's why I return this productI need refund but your claint will told I will give you the replacement.This time also same product will happen amazon people will make a refundAnd one more thing is camera quality also not goodDon't dissapoint with my feedback because this problem is happend.\",\n",

Within 6 mnth it gave me feeling of dabba hai dabba 😒!! Please don’t waste your money on this product, instead of it, invest 2-3k more nd buy a 4 gb ram product.',\n",
              " \"I am a student and it's a best MI phone under this range. Camera quality is a bit low at this price and battery is also good no issue till date (aprox 6 month). But if you are looking for a phone for gaming u need to rise your budget. Otherwise it's good fingerprint scanner is fast and face unloce is super fast the security system is also good. 6gb ram and 128gb storage with this performance in this price is something next level. You still can play many games like standof 2, free fire, etc. which have medium graphic very smoothly. This phone dident disappointed me. I am very satisfied with this phone. I recommend you to buy this phone if u are a student 😃\",\n",
              " 'Redmi 9... Other than MIUI 12.0.5, 4GBRAM &64GB this phone is very ordinary. The CAMERA is worst compared to older phones frm XIAOMI..NO LED LIGHT FOR NOTIFICATIONS...overall nothing impressive in this phone.. Quite disappointed.ADDING one PROS abt the phone:Sound quality is good.Battery life good.',\n",
              " 'Bought 3 weeks Bach.. Touch screen is not that smooth.. does not respond properly..need to click multiple times to perform an operation..terrible experience..not expected from Xiomi..Ihave used multiple redmi phonesstarting 1S every thing was fine.. but this is wasted..not recommend',\n",
              " 'I bought it for my mother, and she is learning to use it. 4GB/64GB at this price is really good. Touch is very responsive and quick. Screen quality is little dull and sound output is low compared to other Redmi phones. Redmi needs to work on these for budget phones. Camera is average as it is not camera centered phone. Network reception and battery power is good, last for 1.5 days with normal usage. Overall good phone for beginners and elderly people to start with',\n",
              " \"Will not find a better phone in this price range. It's good for surfing, YouTube, not for heavy gaming. Small games run good. Have other phones comparing with mi note 9 pro. It's slower. Charging time is standard 70 minutes for full. This phone assures of reliability as built quality is very good\",\n",

Cameras are poor. 2 cameras are in back, 3rd one is just a sticker.4. Phones doesn't feel much strong.5. No Gorilla glass, if I'm not wrong.Excellent phone for price below 9k.

But I need it always online as I am using whatsapp web on my computer always irrespective of whether I use my mobile or not.If the system shows that whatsapp is using battery that simply means that it is in use.

Smooth performance, don't hang with normal usage.Screen quality is good.Finger sensor is very quick.Amazon's 7 day replacement policy is very poor. If your phone has really any defact then only it will get replaced with same model. You can't return & buy another better model.It is just okay type of phone, camera and sound quality is not good, any old 5k phone will give you better picture. Bettery life is good.Redmi 9 is a phone which is quite justified seeing it's price. It has an amazing battery. The storage is more than enough at this price but somehow the camera quality lacks in places that somehow makes you wonder or regret of only I could have gone for Redmi 9 Prime. Anyways. It's a great phone to use. It comes with a 10W charger which takes time but for me it's a plus point cause for my previous phones, I didn't get a charger.Best budget mobile under 9000/-Better to go with Redmi 9 PrimeToo much pre installed apps that never can be uninstalled,so taking many spaces,,,its front and back camera low quality, charging cable is not C type,its the pin type old usb cable, overall I am giving 3* as per my experience,also notable that colour of mobile what i ordered 80 % differentI have used Xiaomi mobiles from past 8 years. I have used redmi 2, redmi 4 and redmi note. But this is the failure model released from Xiaomi. RAM is not upto the mark. Camera quality is very poor. Phone is very slow. I have never used such a phone. Battery also very poor. Kindly don't go for redmi 9 activ. Please go for any other model. Not worthy phone. This is my two months experience.Thank you!Worst product.When we are in conference call getting lot of disturbance. When i filed a complaint.one of the home technician called me and telling me that with out checking the mobile and with out coming to the home.

My entire money has gone for a toss....Please arrange to refund the money wasted in buying the defective product.I have purchased couple of phones of Redmi, but This is the worst phone I have ever got, unfortunately didn't look it's functionality earlier otherwise I would have returned it on same day.Don't pay attention to paid review or the people who never used the good phones.If possible please do get some better phone instead of this.It's a cool phone with an awesome look with good battery life and an average camera. Thought it would be heavy and difficult to handle... But once I held it in my hand it was very lightweight and slim.. overall great phone to buy in such an amazing price!I usually buy phones directly from the Xiomi store.Never ever had any UI or app not loading issue with my older devices with just 3GB of RAM.Have recently purchased this phone on Amazon. It doesn't feel like using 4GB for the same usage.When the UI will be stuck you don't know. Having worst experience. Not sure of the root cause.if u want best features search another model instead if buy Redmi 9Activ.Here is my rating after 1month uses.👉Ram Good👉Storage Good👉Camera Average👉FingerPrint Good👉Disply Touch Average👉Battery Backup GoodI had purchased this Redmi 9 Active phone last week. Writing this review after 7 days of usage. Battery is OK. Camera is OK (I am not a professional photographer) and meets my requirements of taking snaps for regular activities. Processor should have been little bit faster. I am using Note4 (64x4GB variant) as well since last 3 years and I have the impression that this Redmi 9 processor is not that smooth compared to my Old Note4.OsmAmazing experienceAll in oneMind blowing phoneSpecial thanks to mr manu jainCo-founder miLot of thanksI buy this mobile on but there is hitting chargger an mobile both .so I call Amazon customer service there is one executive he told me some software check an update but I don't try because of I buy new phone then why should I try ............that's time executive speak his supiror an told me pls pack this mobile I arrange new pack pic return.Thanks to Amazon return my mobile an give me another mobile within 3 working day's I m very happy my mobile I recieved an check all is working properly.Once again thank executive I forgot that's name but thanks a lots ........I m sure next time any product buy I m going on Amazon ..........Works good. Smooth. But if you have all the social media apps then it may lag a bit. Dont try heavy games. Battery is concerning when all these social apps are in the phone. Camera is ok. Finger print reader is fast\",\n",
              " 'i like the camera it is good ,the screen is also good but i feel that the bezels are somewhat big but the overall form factor is good but the only thing that i am not sure with is the processor as it is a mediatek processor but it works fine it would have been nice if they have given fast charging optionbut for the price it is well rounded so if you are looking for a good phone under 10k go for it',\n",

I can play pubg on it for continue 5 hours after full. So happy that I buyed this mobile. I love the #MI brand very much.#Redmi9_iz_lubI am going to write review about my redmi 9 phone, i bought this phone 2nd time. I truly satisfied with its price rangefor like this featurestic phone.Battery is working whole day for my need.Phone 's body is rough and tough.Camera is actually averaged not super.Fingerprint is works smoothly.And last, screen of the phone is working as like as other redmi phones.Phone never hang.It's speed is also better.In, terms of speed ,memory and ease of use, it's good. Battery and fingerprint reading are excellent. But when, it comes to the speaker output with, certain, well known apps such as zoom, it's not good. Also the recorded voice does not have a reasonably good volume when played back.I bought this mobile for my mom and it was a huge upgrade for her as she was using Redmi 4 earlier. Also I got Rs 2200 discount for the exchange. Overall the mobile is pretty good for daily use. She can make video calls from Whatsapp, browse facebook for a while and watch youtube videos. I have noticed little bit lag while opening the apps but it's not significant. Camera is okay for daytime photography. Overall I will give 3/5.Music player automatically slow down in the middle of the song playing, please response this problem.As per this model of mobile, camera needs protection of back cover because without back cover camera not in a safe position when anybody uses this mobile and puting on table or anywhere.I don't like this you don't provide back cover for this mobile. As per current situation of covid, shops are not opened,I am not able to buy back cover of itThe phone is working fine but not having IR device to operate as TV control as I am doing for earlier amazon redmi3 & Y or Redmi 8 note phones. Else performance wise phone is good.The body of the phone is definitely not like note phones but sounds good.Issues are arising when YouTube videos are played. It is hanging. Chargingis too slow. Even processor is slow.Shall update after 1 month of use. Hope it survives that long.Redmi 9 mobile I was bought a month ago but now phone showing hanging problem it's really shocking to me internal storage 4/64 but i always face hanging problem it's very unfortunately but it's true my opinion to new peoples think about buying this mobile please avoid it.It's a worst mobile phone i have seen ever in my life.... It's very slow and lags frequently during any operation... If there is negetive rating facility then more than 75% people give it negetive ratings... The person who is happy with big screen without any other logic they can give this positive rating for such a third class phone at this high cost....Redmi 9 was not good..After seeing the reviews in Amazon I bought this mobile but camera quality is very poor.. It's been 15 days of using this mobile it's hanging and while speaking others in the call can't able to hear our voice.. I wonder whether this is real product or duplicate I received..

They didn't take any responsibility. Even according to order they should visit my place to check the phone. But they didn't..they just called. And I requested for exchange within 7 days of buying. Pathetic experience.. ...Got this phone for my grandparents, i was able to get a good deal on it.The phone has a nice big screen, display is average quality,definitly good for media consumption,the ui is clear, MIUI is easy to use.The camera is poor thoughbut if 10K is the budget, this is a go to phone, hands-down.Definitly a good buy!!!!the worst phone ever purchased, pathetic one, i know at this budget i can't expect much but atleast should be able to type seamlessly, use some more money n go for something else but never thisApps aren't uninstalling completely.

Camrea clearity is good i just concern about battery, it drain soon.... Otherwise in given price it is a good handsetVery good features for a budget phone. Acceptable performance and for its huge battery surprisingly is light weight. Full day usage sees only 50% of battery left. Screen resolution is so smooth. Highly recommended.Didn't expect such product from Mi. Very low speaker sound compare to redmi 8A which is chipper then this. Performance is also very lagy. With only whats app use without installed any games and apps no smooth operation in phone.Overpriced with regular features. Not much excited about the product Redmi 9 except the size.Delivery Experience was pathetic. Purchased Redmi 9 in exchange of SAMSUNG Pro7 whereas the old phone was not considered for exchange as the delivery executive demanded money. The old mobile phone is in good and running condition. The same can be inspected anytime still. The delivery executive collected Ra 2100/= and demanded more.Overall a good product, as expected from xiaomi phones, but it is frustating when for minimal use the phone hangs, gets stuck. This is not expected from xiaomi at this price range.For a newbie, if you are purchasing for your parents, might work well!Just an ordinary Rs. 6000 phone type.Just quad cam lookwise is a great feature.Otherwise no good pic quality, display also poor.Bought this on flash sale for 10,000. Overall, average product. 😑😐Very Bad Quality product, I never buy any company mobile by Amazone. Directly buy the shop is secure. I buy this mobile its not working Properly, when i called its automatically screen will off, switch off also not working that time, when the other side call will cut screen will on this also sometime only, otherwise wating for around 20 minitue. worthless product. better buy from shop with Warrenty. Battery also no good.Worst product i ever used,,this mobile getting hanged every time ,,already software update,,factory reset and clear cashes everything done but still no use..when ever it hangs i need to click on power button then again it will works,,same happening for last 1 months..i purchased this product before 4-5 months..i didnt expect this kind of a failure product from Mi...Very good product, nice looking,super\",\n",

So please refund meThe media could not be loaded.Fingerprint is not working,display is not working after getting the phone I was so happy but it disappointed me after 10 minutes as the screen strted blinking, touch is not working,anything gets typed automatically again everything is fine after 5-10 minutes and again it started the same. Refund should be given to a customer because how will the customer trust on you whether the replaced product will work fine or not for few days month or on the same day. I want refund of the product.a Perfect Budget phone without type C (which is ok @8.5k-9.5k) previously Redmi 9 with the same specs was coming with type C which was the best in this segment now it comes with Micro USB which is ok if you want good quality with a big screen phone of 4GB-64GB variant in 8.5k-9.5kGives very slow internet connectivity. Online surfing & App download takes forever on this phone despite of good data connectivity from network. Far worse data connectivity compared to Samsung. Display resolution is poor too. Gallery arrangement could have been much better organized rather than displaying all jumbled images.I have upgraded from redmi 5 to this, in design compared to redmi 5 this is not that good. Bettery is good, big dispaly but not bright as redmi 5, performance is ok. Cameras are ok for the price range. Good for online classes for my kid, but not a worthy upgrade to redmi 5.It is the best phone at 8999The fingerprint sensor, and the battery power are good features of this phone. Picture quality with the different cameras are just okay. The phone is working smoothly even with additional installation of other apps.Very Good phone at these price range.In 64 Gb Its already system used 12 Gb.Camera quality poor, Its saying 13 Mega pixel,I don't think so, it maybe 5 Mega pixel.Once I cancel my prime membership,delivery was delay.Thanks Amazon. Now redmi coming made in india stickerI thik it is the best product in this range of smartphone devices. Camera quality is good with AI, but need to improve more. battery life is sufficient for the whole day continuous use. Fingerprint sensor is working smoothly. I mostly use it's focus mode feature to spend my time in fruitful tasks and stay away from any kind of distraction. Overall it is a good product. I like it.Microphone quality very bad.. Whenever we record a Video, its of no use, as we dont listen to person speaking. We had to use Redmi7 to record video to hear voice. Redmi9 is having robust features but is unstable and loses all the sheen with primary things not working like microphone.Screen seems rotating with small shakes ( 90 deg,180 deg) causing Eye strain and wastage of time.\",\n",

Till now i am unable to play it.4.Battery life is just OK5.Overall I am unsatisfied from this phone, I had a big reputation about Redmi phones ,but this Redmi 9 is, failure. Redmi 8 is better, which also I am using, although it is older verdion.Please if you are someone who is dependent on phone for work purpose, Don't buy this you can invest in better phone. Phone is too slow and I bought this on 4th Feb and today 25th Feb the phone is dead and not charging. It hangs most of thee time and There has been a lot of network issue, receiver not able to hear (Its not the SIM problem). Veryyy bad experience with this phone. Super disappointed.Review after long usage.Positive points - battery backup is good. Charging time is ok, as it 10 watt charger.Display is very good, can be visible in sunlight also. UI is lag free.Negative points - No compass, vital features like screen pinning, split screen removed by company.Earlier I was using Samaung M12, for the same price tag any time M12 is better option.Battery life of M12 and Camera Quality is far better.They don't provide screen guard, cover and IR sensorCamera quality is also not upto markAlso don't provide type C data cable for charging and data transferRest all good till nowHi order this phone via amazon by exchange offer,I tried the same with flipkart butthey rejected the phonewhich was working fine.Thanks amazon for accepting the old phone.A big thumbs-up to amazonif your phone is slighty chipped on the corners they void entire warranty and charge you additional service charge of 118 rupees even when you have warranty just tohave a look. worst phone to buy not a common man phone anymore.. worst camera and they have removed the IR blasterThe media could not be loaded.Faulty Device delivered with serious charging issues. The phone got bend while charging and now we are supposed to pay the service charge for companies or sellers mistake. The service charge cost more than 25% of phones total price and customer care says it is out of warranty because of bend issue even when there are no other screen damages or anything which looks like a customer issue. Worst seller and worst customer support. I demand a compensation for my lossThe photo quality is worse compared to any phone in this budget.The build quality and color are good.Not seen any performance issues.. I'm only dissatisfied with the camera.. Very bad quality of picturesBest mobile configuration in this cost segment.If you expect good camera quality then check the pixel before buying.Satisfactory image quality found.Front camera is a bit dull though the back camera of 13+2 MP makes it over.Overall nice experience and satisfied with the purchase till now.\",\n",

What else you can get at this price range.. The sound quality is amazing... It's loud and clear.The fingerprint reader is aso amazing....it's fast and responsive.The battery life is also good considering average usage...Works for one and half day.It takes time to open any application even there is free memory. And the transition frames are clearly visible while opening any application.Pathetic Mobile. Never ever go for it.Disappointment from MI.Worst camera and speaker quality, I want toreturn and asking for refund but Amazon did not provide the refund option only replacement available forthis mobile, I am wasted my money by purchasing this mobile, very bad experienceBeware.. Don't just look at the cost.This mobile does not have gyroscope sensor. So you cannot view VR (virtual reality) Google VR app is not compatinle with this mobile.Also there is no infrared so you cannot use the MI remote to operate TV, SET TOPBOX Or Your AC.Battery is good, fingerprint sensors are average, screen size is good and works well under bright sunlight.Coming to the camera, camera is below average, I compared the camera with realme 1 phone and picture quality of redmi 9 is poor as compare to realme 1.such a bad experience of this product , after purchasing this product not used almost 8 days and on the next day try to use this phone , it is not working, not even switch on the phone , so immediately taken in to service centre , they checked informed their is a software problem it seems, such a new phone have a software problem , how can sell the product to customer ???I was very confused to see both negative and Positive comments but postive comments made me trust and i ordered it , it came out amazing i like th quality of the cameraVolume is also nice . I trust only in Redmi so made my decision nd ordered it for my dad*********************************If you want to purchase for online clss , parents,Then go for itAmazing phone under 10kBelive in redmiWithin 2 months the device showed issue by not connecting to mobile network. Tried re- booting and re-inserting sim but nothing working... It was really frustrating experience.. Primary purpose of a mobile phone has stopped working..Called Service centre and I was informed about a couple of steps including some updates and factory reset. There was some issue with the software updates, which was supposed to be automatic OTA. If an update (which the user was not aware of) stops the phone to connect to a mobile network, then it is really tough to debug, if someone is not there to help you with the required wifi or technical expertise.HeyHighly recommend if you are a Buddha or buddhi but if you are young go for any 3gb ram phone instead of this as it doesn’t look premium where as other phone have that looksBut if you have to do heavy work ya it can do that but only thing the camera quality is really bad oneCamera quality not great compared to Oppo.... I don't recommend buying this phone. It gets heated up too soon and sometimes screen gets frozen or keeps flickering...\",\n",

None can hear you from other side without literally like barking.OK, Phone for a regular user.* Use for a month and heating issue if play games or in charging.*Battery is not as per details, only one day use.*Gave it to mother as it was not for a regular user phone who wants To watch Heavy Videos,Surfing, Browsing, Calling.

For their usage (mostly watching youtube, whatsapp, zoom calls, MS teams, and other common applications) this has been a good gadget. With 126GB internal memory, this phone is not going to indicate memory low even if they receive 100s of social media forwards and voice notes.

The fingerprint quality, processor and battery life are all very satisfactory.I just love it. I bought it for my mom and she is happy with the phone. Dont think just buy it. You are doing a right thing. Best battery, great camera, loud volume . Its a fantastic phonePHONE IS WORTH OF MONEY BUY CAMERA IS LIKE 1.5 MP , PROCESSOR IS SLOW GAMER NOT BUY IT SPACE IS GOOD , RAM CLOCK SPEED IS LOW.BUT FOR SMALL BUDGET ITS CHUMMESWARI PHONEIts a good buy- under ₹12K with (6+128) GB storage facility. Battery life is good- runs full 36hours of active usage if not heavy. Other features like other Redmi products. Only major drawback is it camera. It seriously lags behind- both front & rear camera aren't upto the mark.I got this phone yesterday loved the look, but I can see poor camera photos are ok not great at this price point. Sound in the handset is very poor. Default ringtone is not hearing when kept in bag or pocket. Says phone have quick charge but that's not true took almost 90 mins to complete the Charing.Redmi still using old USB Chargers not C Cable for even new models, USB Chargers won’t last long and always develops faults after some usage so ideally MI wants to u to buy new phones every month. Going to tweet to MI India BossUntill redmi stops barging into all private spaces with ads, user will be dissatisfied in a corner using a best phone for given price. Everything is great except those annoying ads. Why can't everything be stock android ?Good option after Realme Narzo 10A and C3Its a big loss to buy Redmi 9, the battery doesn't run whole day, must give charge 2/3 times in a day, camera quality is worse one.... screen quality is nice... It's just have more storage capacity in this price then the others mobile brand.It's been 4 months I have been using this phone... Camera quality bad n the phone is getting hanged many times... After long time a got phone which is not worth it.. The touch pad is not good as well... Plz don't go fr it... Even if u have any emergency try some other one not this one\",\n",

Redme 9 Active was mentiond but in product description it is showing as Redme 9 only.I want to returnI am writing this after uses of 15days, battery backup is decent, but if you are looking for good camara then this is not for you..I m very disappointed with the camara qualityAfter using one week only it started hanging from first week only, It shows internal memory full even when i have not downloaded anything, 6 GM RAM is just for name there is no such speed according to RAM installed. I really upset after buying this phoneExtremely poor camera quality, which makes one reconsider his decision on this purchase. Definitely can improve the quality so can get a good picture, if not the enhanced quality.I have purchased this phone after seeing reviews but This phone is not good. I am a Amazon prime member and believe in Amazon platform. Now I am very frustrated with its working and performance. I have contacted 3 times to customer service but there is not good response and phone have hardware & software failure defects.Please let me know how I can refund or replace or return it.I wish I had seen the reviews before purchasing this phone. The front camera is so horrible that I'm wondering if their so called specification of ai enabled selfie camera is even true. Would not recommend this phone to anyone. So disappointedPhone is good. Processing speed is ok but the camera is worst. If you love taking pictures then it's not for you. Believe me you'll regret if you buy it. On the other hand if you are going it for parents or anyone elder in your family then its good for their use.\",\n",

And if you look closely, you can see the pixels. But 6GB ram and 128Gb memory at this price, I mean common something has to be bad. If you are not a selfie guy and want performance this is for you at this budget. It is not for selfie queens or cool selfie chapris. Lol.I am using Xiaomi phones from a long time and I always recommend to buy Xiaomi phones because it gives you the same features at lowest price than other brands. The build quality of the phone is good, the camera quality is nice at this price range and it have a big battery life. Just giving 4 stars because I didn't find any discount deal on it.battery performance is not satisfied.it is said on the label 5000 mah but it acts like 2000 mah battery.No back key. Lots of Xiaomi advertisement. If you don't keep phone in normal state all of a sudden, redial takes place automatically. Sometimes, some app start functioning without knowledge. Slow chargingThis review about bought after 3 months. Good sound. Camera is ok but not good. Awesome batter life- good stand by. Budget mobile. My suggestion is that put D+ temper glass(150 rs only), don't use normal temper. D+ is much stronger and long laster, hard to break the glass when mobile slip down to the floor and no air enter between temper and display glass.I bought this for my mother in law and she expressed that it is not receiving the signal properly where as my father in law samsung at the same home same location is working all fine with same service provider.Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.Phone is good in segment, i love the display its very clear and detailing.Battery back up is super, goor performance, built quality finishing etc are excellent, on the part of camera iam very disappointed cz redmi need to improve the clarity of camera considering the other company in this segment. Just ok thats all about camera. Otherwise its a nice pack and value for moneyThis mobile come with 6gb/128, useless specification, because processor come with hileo g35 a very low end old processor, Canara is also bad, for Gamer= this product doesn'tsupport gyroscope,and not compass sensior, and it come with 10w adapter again a slow charger, my suggestion.... Buy realme narzo 50 this is a great product and also good for gammerIt's a bit laggy when you play games like among us or roblox on it. Else it's totally fair for the price. And the problem which I am facing the most is this phone is very heavy and it's horizontally long and vertically small. This makes it very hard to hold the phone in one hand. Also there is actually only 2 cameras whereas when you look at it from outside it d look like it has 3 cameras. Xiaomi please fix this as no one wants an unnecessary camera just for show off.\",\n",

Battery life is excellent.Overall value for Money..It's really worth for buying on Rs. 7559. Thanks to Amazon for this great phone with this offer price.Camera is good on Sunlight, not upto the level night mode, but we can't expect more on this price.Fingerprint is too fast and Battery is really superb.Good battery performance. Fingerprint reader is also fast & hassle-free. Value for money within the price range & i m a happy user!The phone is quite good for the the price I paid however I absolutely hate that it does not have split screen option and does not support 5ghz bandwidth either.. other cheaper phones have those yet redmi 9 doesn't.Apart from that the phone is running good.. worth the money if the above two things are added.Battery life is good and finger print also working properly and camera is ok type if u compare with the price range.....Reviewing after 1 month of using ...it's a nice phone I gifted toaunty and she likes it very much 👍 good quality and design. In this price range it's a good phone for those who are not using phone that much.Purchased it for a good price of 7.9k after bank offer.Very good value formoney for the product at this price range. Camera quality is average and good photos are available only at bright lights. Go for this phone if you are budget conscious or want to gift elderly people.Purchased this phone on 6/6/2021. Within six month the screen of the mobile is facing issues. Screen getting automatically locked while on call. sometimes it getting lock while surfing. The speaker volume is too low even on speaker mode. I can't recommend anyone to buy this phone from this vender.Ok okDon't buy!!!!!!!!!!!!Amazon is Fooling us,waste of money ,Camery very low ,System problem ,Many problems occurred after seven days of receiving , Went to centre 6-7 times but not solved yet, (Go for another phone but not this)This is my experience and I'm sure you should not buy this *****\",\n",
